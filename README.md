#pyWeather:
=========
This project displays weather information from weather.com on the raspberry pi using the awesome little 2.8" tft LCD display from Adafruit [[link](http://www.adafruit.com/product/1601)]

It just wraps up the project made by Jacotronix [[link](https://github.com/jacotronix/net.jacotronix.python.PiTFTWeather)] as a resin.io project so it is easily deployable to multiple raspberry pis with one simple git push.

All the kernel module installation and setup to get the piTFT working is handled in the Dockerfile, so it is simple to get it working and start building your own user interfaces on the tiny screen.
