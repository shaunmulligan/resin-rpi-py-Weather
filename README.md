#pyWeather:
=========
This project displays weather information from weather.com on the raspberry pi using the awesome little 2.8" tft LCD display from Adafruit [[link](http://www.adafruit.com/product/1601)]

It just wraps up the project made by Jacotronix [[link](https://github.com/jacotronix/net.jacotronix.python.PiTFTWeather)] as a resin.io project so it is easily deployable to multiple raspberry pis with one simple git push.
